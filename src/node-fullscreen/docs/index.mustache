<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Adds the following methods to Y.Node instances:</p>

<table class="yui-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>isFullScreen</td>
      <td>Whether or not the node is currently in full screen mode.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>canGoFullScreen</td>
      <td>Whether or not the node is currently can be put into full screen mode.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>requestFullScreen</td>
      <td>Attempts to make the node full screen.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>cancelFullScreen</td>
      <td>Brings the node out of full screen mode.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Nodes put into full screen mode will fire a <code>fullscreenchange</code> event. Full screen is not implemented the same way in all browsersâ€”some browsers support putting any element in full screen mode, others support only a subset of elements. If full screen is supported in the the browser, <code>Y.Node.SUPPORTS_FULLSCREEN</code> will be set to <code>true</code>.</p>
